<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <p>I am an Associate Professor (MaÃ®tre de ConfÃ©rences) at IMT Mines AlÃ¨s. My research focuses on AI-driven multimodal learning for biomedical applications. Previously, I was a researcher at <a href="https://nouveau.univ-brest.fr/latim/fr">LaTIM</a> (UMR 1101 INSERM, Brest, France), where I worked on applying AI to medical imaging and computational modeling.</p>

  <p>I hold a Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from Universidad PolitÃ©cnica de Madrid, an M.Sc. in Systems and Services Engineering for the Information Society from the same institution, and a Bachelor's degree from Universidad PolitÃ©cnica del Litoral, Guayaquil, Ecuador.</p>

  <p>My expertise lies in image processing, computer vision, and deep learning, with a particular focus on biomarker extraction from physiological and pathological processes. I explore multimodal learning and foundational models to advance oncology and clinical decision support. A key aspect of my work is enhancing AI model interpretability and explainability, ensuring their practical application in real-world clinical settings.</p>
